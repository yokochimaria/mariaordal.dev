# mariaordal.dev

Hi there! Welcome to my personal website! This site is meant to give a glimpse into some of what I've done and perhaps give a sense of what it would be like to work together. I designed and built this site after I finished my real job over for the summer in the week and a half of free time I had before a friend from out of town came to visit (after which I would head straight back to school). I'm sure with time, this site will grow and develop (as will I!).

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3 for frontend
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- Figma (<3) for ideation, prototyping, and creating assets

## Usage
